This is the Tech assignment from Magni, for the front-end position at Sportradar.

To get project up and running:

1. Clone the project, using an IDE of your choice (Visual Studio Code, for example).
2. Open the folder made by doing that, and open the terminal.
3. Run the command `npm install`
4. After that's done, you can start the dev build by running the command `npm run dev` or the command `npm run build` followed by `npm run preview` for a normal build.

Have a nice day! :D
