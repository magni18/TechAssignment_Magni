This is the Tech assignment from Magni, for the front-end position at Sportradar.

To get project up and running:

1. Make sure that you have node.js installed on your machine. To install, go to [the node website](https://nodejs.org/en/download), and follow the instructions there, using the terminal or installing node.js using an installer.

To check if you have installed it correctly, you can use these commands in the terminal:
`npm -v`
`node -v`

If you get a version number, then the installation was successful.

2. Clone the project, using an IDE of your choice (Visual Studio Code, for example).
3. Open the folder made by doing that, and open the terminal.
4. Run the command `npm install`
5. After that's done, you can start the dev build by running the command:
   `npm run dev`

- You can also run the command `npm run build` followed by `npm run preview` for a normal build.

To see the app, you need to open the URL indicated in the terminal, in a browser.

Have a nice day! :D
